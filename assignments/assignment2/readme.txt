Assignment 2, Thomas Steinthal

TL;DR
- The two notebooks are quite similar and could be optimised with scripting
- The second notebook (NN) just loads the vectorizer to prevent redundancy
- The models perform fairly similar, accuracy around 0.83
- All the specific comments are contained in the notebooks. Because this exercise is more formal, I haven't found further documentation unnecessary
- For the same reasons I haven't included functions in this assignment, however, they should be included if the notebooks are converted to scripts
